In the following SQL analysis, I am using a database with numerous tables to reveal statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID";

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM JanSales;

SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
AND Product = "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.OrderID
WHERE length(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT * 
FROM JanSales
Limit 5;

SELECT Product, price 
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

Select *
FROM JanSales;

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue, product
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(OrderID)=6
AND OrderID <> "Order ID"
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT * FROM FebSales;

SELECT product, sum(quantity) AS quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT * FROM FebSales;

SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) AS AVG_Amt_Spent
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(FebSales.orderID)=6
AND FebSales.orderID<>"Order ID";

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT * FROM FebSales
LIMIT 5;

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)AS Quantity_Sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE location like "%Los Angeles%"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"
Group BY Product;
